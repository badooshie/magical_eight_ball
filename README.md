# magical_eight_ball
Can a magic eight ball be better? I think yes. This magic eight ball not only answers your questions, but shows you search results that help push your questions into reality.

# The idea
A normal magic eight ball just gives you a simple answer. Although fun, we can improve on this idea.
This magical eight ball will:
 - Allow the user to ask a question
 - give back a random answer in magic eight ball format
 - offer to open a webpage based on question and answer

Some interesting feature ideas:
 - The webpage returned will be a search comrpised of NLP performed on the question to find the important parts of the question.  These important parts will build the search performed.
 - Since the magic eightball's returned answer will either be negative towards the question or positive, this must reflect in the results.  For example if the questions is: "Will I win the lottery?" Some example answrs might be "yes" or "no way".  If yes, the search results, should comprise of winning the lottery, financial planning, where to spend you money and so on. If no way, attempt to return negative results, such as, how to save money, how to be frugal, free things to do around town and so on.
